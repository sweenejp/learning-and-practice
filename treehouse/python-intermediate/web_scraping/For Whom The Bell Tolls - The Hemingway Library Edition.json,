[{"created":"20200827161600000","text":"For Whom The Bell Tolls - The Hemingway Library Edition by ['Ernest Hemingway']\n\nPublished: 2020\n\n<<<\nIntroduced by Hemingway’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this newly annotated
edition and literary masterpiece about an American in the Spanish Civil War
features early drafts and supplementary material—including three previously
uncollected short stories on war by one the greatest writers on the subject
in history. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil
war for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he
completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” and one of
the foremost classics of war literature in history. Published in 1940, For
Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the
tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan is a young American in the
International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the
mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful
Maria and his superb account of El Sordo’s last stand, Hemingway creates a
work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving,
and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,” Maxwell
Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no one ever so
completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope, and more
intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, it stands as
one of the best war novels of all time. Featuring early drafts and
manuscript notes, some of Hemingway’s writings during the Spanish Civil
War, and three previously collected stories of his on the subject of war,
as well as a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a
new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of
For Whom the Bell Tolls brings new life to a literary master’s epic like
never before.\n<<<\n\n[img[http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781476787817-L.jpg]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","title":"For Whom The Bell Tolls - The Hemingway Library Edition","tags":"Watched/Listened/Read","modified":"20200827161600001"}]
