[{"created":"1598555845.346689","text":"Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance - An Inquiry Into Values by ['Robert M. Pirsig']\n\nPublished: 2006\n\n<<<\nOne of the most important and influential books written in the past half-
century, Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a
powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a
breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that
transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle
trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son.
A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that
becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's
fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both
touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence
. . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.
