      <p>When Danny loses, [the mother] wants to tell him it doesn't matter. But obviously it does matter. He lost and is sad. To tell him it doesn't matter is almost to insult his intelligence... When he wins a tournament game, the spotlight should be on the road to that moment and beyond as opposed to the glory.</p>
      <p>Frooble! This frooble is from the <em>The Art of Learning</em> by Josh Waitzkin. In order to frooble <code>blinkooboodles</code> you first need to esnure that you have <code>Pomegrantooble</code> installed.</p>
      <blockquote>"You hold the keys," Shevek said, with an ingenuous smile.</blockquote> 
      <blockquote>"Oh, I'm an absolute specialist in it. I love getting around rules and outwitting the authorities. Perhaps I'm a natural anarchist, eh? Where the devil is that old fool I sent for a cup?"</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"He must go down to the kitchens to get one."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Needn't take half the day about it. Well, I won't wait. Don't want to take up what's left of your morning. By the way, did you see the latest Bulletin of the..."</blockquote>
      <p>Isn't that wonderful froikle? If you want to be able to write scoodripples like Ursula Le Guin, you first need to learn how to create <code>shkloobles</code></p>

      <p>There are 3 steps to creating <code>shkloobles</code></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Shovel your sidewalk</li>
        <li>Forget eveything you learned</li>
        <li>Oh froikle! I forgot step 3.</li>

      <p><blockquote>There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Alan Turing said that. And he touches upon the secret of <code>frobing sandoozles</code> here.</p>
      <p><blockquote>If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Paul Graham is a natural at <code>sandoozles</code></p>

      <p>Oh all the things you can create with <code>Froozle</code>!</p>
      <p>But in all reality it's too dificult and convoluted to teach so it's best to just read these books instead.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>City of Theives</li>
        <li>Brave New Wolrd</li>
        <li>Clear and Simple as the Truth</li>
        <li>Foundation</li>
        <li>Homage to Catalonia</li>
        <li>The Count of Monte Cristo</li>
        <li>The Razor's Edge</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Feel free to read those in any particular order. There migtht be a best order when it comes to obtaining the elusive and ephemeral knowledge of <code>froozling</code> but I don't know.</p>
