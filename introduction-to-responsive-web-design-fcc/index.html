          <p>A whole bunch of random words go here: “What’s the good of knowledge if you aren’t going to do anything with it?”</p>
          <p>“Perhaps he is. Perhaps it will be a sufficient satisfaction merely to know, as it’s a sufficient satisfaction to an artist to produce a work of art. And perhaps it’s only a step towards something further.”</p>

          <p>(Note from 3/23/20 - I’m so glad that I wrote that quote down. Later, on March 1st of 2020 I essentially wrote an entry that is about the same thing even though I didn’t remember that I wrote this quote down. I don’t mention the quote or the book in that entry. This is exactly why journaling is interesting. I can see how previous knowledge influences later ideas. Before I wrote the entry on March 1st, I remember thinking about those ideas for a week or so before writing it. It’s super interesting to know that this quote from The Razor’s Edge had had an influence on me.)</p>

          <p>Just talked to Erin about this scene recently. Really it’s a whole chapter. When the young guerilla goes through all the trouble to give his message to the general, but it’s all in vain. It’s a bit of a story within the story and highlights the same theme - the futileness of their efforts. That’s not my favorite scene (too many to choose from) just the one that first came to mind.</p>

          <p>I’ll leave it there for now. That actually wasn’t as hard as I thought. I had the idea because I was worried that I forget everything about the books I read. It’d be a shame to forget everything you read - then why read it at all? Maybe because it’s intrinsically pleasing to read. Even if I forget everything about a book, was it still worth it to read it? Isn’t it worth it if I enjoyed reading it at the time?</p>
          <p>I actually had a similar thought while at the cabin this year. While looking through old pictures of us, there were a few that I totally didn’t recognize. It got me thinking about memory. Do we enjoy things just because we remember them? Other people have brought up similar questions. It reminds me of the anesthesia vs induced amnesia thought experiment. Obviously I would choose anesthesia, but is it that much different if you just don’t remember it?></p> 
          <p>One thing I know for sure is that it is fun to recall good memories. We did a bunch of that at Greg’s wedding and at the cabin this summer. So yet another reason to keep this journal. It will hopefully help me remember things.</p>

          <p>Everyone races to learn more and more, but nothing is done deeply. Things look pretty but they are superficial, without a sound body mechanic or principled foundation. Nothing is learned at a high level and what results are form collectors with fancy kicks and twirls that have absolutely no martial value.</p>
