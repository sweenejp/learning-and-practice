            <h2 class="article-title">The Definition of Humility</h2>
            <p class="article-body"><strong>“You suggest studying harder,</strong> and the student replies: “No, it wouldn’t work for me; I’m not one of the smart kids like you; nay, one so lowly as myself can hope for no better lot.” This is social modesty, not humility. It has to do with regulating status in the tribe, rather than scientific process. If you ask someone to “be more humble,” by default they’ll associate the words to social modesty—which is an intuitive, everyday, ancestrally relevant concept. Scientific humility is a more recent and rarefied invention, and it is not inherently social. Scientific humility is something you would practice even if you were alone in a spacesuit, light years from Earth with no one watching. Or even if you received an absolute guarantee that no one would ever criticize you again, no matter what you said or thought of yourself. You’d still double-check your calculations if you were wise.”<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GrDqnMjhqoxiqpQPw/the-proper-use-of-humility"> - Eliezer Yudkowsky</a></p>

            <p class="article-body">It felt like I was watching a movie as opposed to seeing what was in front of me. My vision was a screen. The vision in front of me wasn’t necessarily filled with objects but instead my vision was simply, again, a screen. I can’t seem to explain it any better than that. And I’ve actually had this feeling before. About 2 years ago when I first started trying to practice meditation, I remember how I had a similar feeling while at a mass with Erin. I was bored so I figured I should try meditating. I found that it felt like I was watching a movie. Or rather, my vision simply was the TV screen and nothing else.</p>

            <p class="article-body">Everyone was very polite and talked a great deal, but not about anything interesting; and they smiled so much they looked anxious. But their clothes were gorgeous, indeed they seemed to put all the lightheartedness their manner lacked into their clothes, and their food, and all the different things they drank, and the lavish furnishings and ornaments of the rooms in the palaces where the receptions were held.</p>
