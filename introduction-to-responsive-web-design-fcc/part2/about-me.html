        <p class="about-me-body">He sort of tells us about him crying about his dying father, yet, it's often what he doesn't tell us that seems to tell us a great deal about him. He leaves out what must any details about what must have been a close relationship and flirting-with-romantic relationship between himself and Miss Kenton. How else could their relationship gone from disgust to admiration on the part of Miss Kenton if there wasn't something there? Yet, Stevens doesn't ever talk about it - he insists that they were purely professional. The one time he lets slip is the story of Miss Kenton prying the love novel from his hands while they are in his pantry. And he muses that this was an interesting and curious anecdote - one that, only now, he seems to be considering could have been romantic in nature. Bullshit, Mr. Stevens. He's simply trying to throw a bone to whoever it is he writing to (who is he writing to by the way?). Throwing a bone as if to say, "well, sure maybe there was something there if you view it in a particular context. But, no, that wouldn't be the most prudent, parsimonious way to explain that particular event."</p>
