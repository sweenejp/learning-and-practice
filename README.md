# My Learning and Practice Repository

This is where I store files that I have been working on that are soley for practice and to later reference. Many of these files follow along with online tutorials or practice projects.

Some of these practice projects will evolve into respositories of their own.

My progress and notes are documented here: [Coding/Development Notebook](https://sweenejp.github.io/blog-notebook/)
